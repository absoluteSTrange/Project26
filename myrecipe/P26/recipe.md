Making Tamarind Pulp
Soak 1 tablespoon tamarind in ⅓ cup hot water for 20 to 30 minutes.
Once the tamarind gets soft, then squeeze the tamarind in the water itself. Discard the strained tamarind and keep the tamarind pulp aside.
Cooking Lentils
Rinse ½ cup tuvar dal (100 grams) a couple of times in water.
Drain all the water and add the dal in a 2 litre pressure cooker. Also add ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder.
Add 1.5 to 1.75 cups water and mix. Cover and pressure cook dal for 7 to 8 whistles or 10 to 12 minutes on medium flame.
When the pressure settles down on its own, open the lid and check the dal. The dal should be completely cooked and mushy.
Mash the dal with a spoon or wired whisk. Cover and keep aside. You can see the consistency of dal in the pic below.
Cooking Vegetables
When the dal is pressure cooking – rinse, peel and chop the vegetables.
Take 1 to 1.5 cups chopped vegetables in a pan or pot. Also add 6 to 7 pearl onions or 1 small to medium onion (thickly sliced) and 1 small to medium tomato (quartered).
Sprinkle ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder, ¼ teaspoon kashmiri red chilli powder and salt as per taste. Adding kashmiri red chili powder is optional and can be skipped. 
Add 1.5 to 2 cups water and stir.
Keep the pan on a stove top and begin to cook vegetables on a medium-low to medium flame. In between do check when the vegetables are cooking.
Cook till the vegetables are almost done. Ensure that you don’t over cook the vegetables.
Making Sambar
Once the vegetables are almost cooked, then add the tamarind pulp and 1 to 1.5 tablespoons sambar powder. mix well.
Add the mashed dal. mix again very well.
Simmer on a medium-low flame till it comes to a boil. 
You will see a frothy layer on top when the sambar begins boiling. At this step switch off flame. Cover and keep aside.
Tempering
In a small pan or tadka pan, heat 2 tablespoons gingelly oil. Add ½ tsp mustard seeds.
Let the mustard seeds crackle.
Then add 1 to 2 dry red chillies (halved and seeds removed).
Immediately add 10 to 12 curry leaves, 5 to 6 methi seeds and 2 pinches of asafoetida (hing).
Fry them till the red chilies change color and curry leaves become crisp.
Immediately add this tempering mixture in the hot sambar.
Cover the pan with its lid for 4 to 5 minutes, so that the aroma and flavors from the tempering mixture gets infused with the sambar.
Serve sambar hot. You can garnish it with a few coriander leaves if you prefer. It can also be served with steamed rice, idli, dosa, medu vada or uttapam.
